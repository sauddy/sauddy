- 👋 Hi, I’m @sauddy
- 👀 I’m interested in developing Deep Learning models to detect exoplanets from Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). 
- Additioanlly, I run computer simulations (Magnetohydrodynamic models) to study the formation of Planet and Star formation. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning apply Generative models like GAN
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ML projects with application in Astrophysics.
- 📫 You can reach me @sayantanauddyy21@gmail.com
