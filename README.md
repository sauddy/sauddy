- 👋 Hi, I’m @Sayantan. I am currently an NPP fellow at NASA Jet Propulsion Lab. I research the intersection of physics and machine learning.
- 👀 I’m also developing Deep Learning models to detect exoplanets from the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). 
     Additionally, I run computer simulations (Magnetohydrodynamic models) to study the formation of Planet and Star formation. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to apply Generative models like GAN
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ML projects with applications in Astrophysics.
- 📫 You can reach me @sayantanauddyy21@gmail.com
